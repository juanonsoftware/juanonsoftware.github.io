title: An easy and safe way upgrate application's data
tags: [studying]

When upgrating an application to a newer version, it often requires to migrate its data (including
delete/update some entities, add some new entities / configurations). Even on development phase,
we often need to build some sample data for dev / test environments and also reference data for production environment.
DataUp comes to simplify this work.

## How to use

1. Create a console application (or any kind if fit your need).
The console app is better as it's easier for automation.

2. Create your data revision as a .NET class, implements the interface `IDataRevision`

- VersionNumber property is used to determine which revisions should be executed, small values first.

- Execute method handles migration logic.

3. Configuration

By convention, a connection string `DataUp` must be configured into .config file for `DataUpContext`.
In case of using the same database as the application, you must be aware that table `Revisions` will be used for DataUp.

```
<add name="DataUp" connectionString="server=.\SQLExpress;Database=App01DataUp;Integrated Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
```

## Examples

## Requirements

DataUp is based on .NET 4.5 and EntityFramework 6.1.3.

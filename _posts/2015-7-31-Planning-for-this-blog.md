title: Components on for this blog
---

This blog was forked from JekyllNow with basic features. Some other features should be added
to make the site richer in term of communication, content formatting... And below is some of them
that I am thinking of.

## Category & tag
As the time goes, number of post will be increased. It's better if it can group posts by a specific
category.

## Comment
Each post should have ability to leave a comment. This way the original post can be improved by
considering other ones' ideas.

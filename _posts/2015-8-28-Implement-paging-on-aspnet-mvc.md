title: How to implement pagination on ASP.NET MVC4
---


Pagination !!! This task is very common as almost application requires pagination when listing data.
So how is a good direction to complete this task? I did it again today and below is how it has been completed.

# Any library out there?

Yes, there are many. I did not look around lot of them but doing search will give many results.
The two libraries I spent time to do some testing are PagedList [1] and mvcpaging [2].

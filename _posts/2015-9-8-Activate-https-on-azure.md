title: Activate HTTPS on Azure Website
---

My story is that the website deployed on Azure needs to have Disqus function... It should be trivial
because Disqus provide a nice plugin and just some simple configuration steps are required.
It's nothing but `https` is required. It impires me to create a new attribute called `RequireHttpsInProductionAttribute`.

## Available ways

There are some ways already to make it working from [Two Methods][1] or [HTTPS only on Windows Azure Web Sites][2]

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/config-https-only.png)

but it doesn't fit to my case : development environment shouldn't be effected, it changes only the production.
Then the new attribute was born ;)

## RequireHttpsInProductionAttribute

So it adapts for these requirements
- Locally should not be effected by default, otherwise it needs to be set.
- When having some test environments (based on hostname) it should exclude this check.

Then it will be registered as usual
```
filters.Add(new RequireHttpsInProductionAttribute());
```

Below is main part of the attribute, and [full version here][3]
